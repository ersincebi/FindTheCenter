# FindTheCenter
  I try to create this OpenAi Gym Like environment for my Q and DQN learning project.
 # Getting Started
  Some libraries needs to be installed these are;
    - Pyglet
    - numpy
    - Matplotlib
   For DQN model you need;
    - Tensorflow 2
  In DQN model you can reach under folder libs, I also use [Kfocussing](https://github.com/btekgit/FocusingNeuron-Keras) Neuron option. 
  The environment has four direction diagonaly. By using that four direction it tries to find the center piece.
  Every thing can controllable under libs>game_rules file.
